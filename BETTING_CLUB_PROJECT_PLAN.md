# Soccer Data Scraper + Betting Club - Comprehensive Project Plan

## Project Vision

**Ultimate Goal**: Build a "Super Cool Betting Club" management system with automated data flow:
`Scraped Fixtures → Betting Interface → Match Results → League Table Updates`

**Current State**: Working soccer data scraper (Flask + React + Python) + MCP server integration
**Target State**: Full-stack betting club with public dashboard, admin interface, and multi-agent development workflow

## Betting Club Priorities
1. **Open Access**: No logins, no authentication - public dashboard accessible to all
2. **Admin Efficiency**: Weekly updates must take <10 minutes total
3. **Mobile-First Design**: Players check standings on phones - optimize for mobile
4. **Reliability Over Features**: Core flow (fixtures → bets → results → standings) must always work
5. **Bold Sports Design**: Black (#000000), Red (#DC2626), Yellow (#FBBF24) color scheme
6. **WhatsApp Integration**: Admin inputs bets from WhatsApp messages efficiently

**Specialized Layer**: Agent-specific tools
- sqlite (betting database operations)
- filesystem (project file management)
- fetch (web scraping and API calls)
- github (version control)
- time (match scheduling utilities)
- whatsapp (bet parsing - optional)
- interactive (admin workflow efficiency)

### API Structure
```
/api/fixtures          - Current scraper data
/api/results           - Match results from scraper
