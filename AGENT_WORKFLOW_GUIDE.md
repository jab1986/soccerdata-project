# Betting Club Agent Workflow Guide

## Quick Start: 5-Agent Parallel Development

### Terminal Setup
Open 5 terminal panes in Warp, each with a specialized agent:

```bash
# Pane 1: Data Integration Agent
# Focus: Scraped data → Betting system integration

# Pane 2: Betting System API Agent  
# Focus: Backend betting functionality

# Pane 3: Betting Club UI Agent
# Focus: Mobile-first dashboard + admin interface

# Pane 4: Integration Testing Agent
# Focus: End-to-end workflow testing

# Pane 5: System Integration Agent
# Focus: Database, deployment, system integration
```

## Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1) - Parallel Execution

### 🔍 **Data Integration Agent Tasks**
```bash
# Start with data pipeline enhancement
python run.py comprehensive
python scripts/update_results.py  # New script for results
grep -i "completed|final" data/*.csv  # Validate results data
```

### ⚙️ **Betting System API Agent Tasks**  
```bash
# Setup betting API foundation
python run.py api
curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/api/betting-data
sqlite3 betting_club.db ".schema"  # Database setup
```

### 🎨 **Betting Club UI Agent Tasks**
```bash
# Setup mobile-first interface
cd frontend
npm install @types/react @types/node tailwindcss
npm start
# Focus on mobile-first league table component
```

### 🧪 **Integration Testing Agent Tasks**
```bash
# Setup comprehensive testing
python test_betting_integration.py
python test_mobile_responsiveness.py
curl -s http://localhost:5000/api/betting/standings | jq
```

### 🔧 **System Integration Agent Tasks**
```bash
# Setup unified system architecture  
git status
sqlite3 betting_club.db "SELECT * FROM players LIMIT 5;"
docker-compose --version  # Prepare containerization
```

## Key Workflow Patterns

### Daily Standups (via Agent Management Panel)
1. **Check agent status** in top-right panel
2. **Review completed tasks** across all agents
3. **Identify blockers** and cross-agent dependencies
4. **Assign next priority tasks** based on project phase

### Cross-Agent Coordination
- **Data Integration** provides clean data → **API Agent** consumes it
- **API Agent** creates endpoints → **UI Agent** builds interface  
- **UI Agent** builds components → **Testing Agent** validates them
- **Testing Agent** finds issues → **Integration Agent** deploys fixes

### Mobile-First Development Pattern
All agents prioritize mobile responsiveness:
- **Data Agent**: Lightweight data formats
- **API Agent**: Fast response times
- **UI Agent**: Mobile-first responsive design
- **Testing Agent**: Mobile browser testing
- **Integration Agent**: Mobile performance monitoring

## Weekly Workflow: Admin Efficiency Target (<10 minutes)

### Admin's Weekly Tasks (What the system should support):
1. **Receive WhatsApp bets** → Quick parsing and input (2-3 minutes)
2. **Check match results** → Automatic scraper updates (0 minutes - automated)
3. **Verify league table** → Automatic calculation (0 minutes - automated)  
4. **Handle corrections** → Quick admin interface (2-3 minutes)
5. **Review statistics** → Automatic generation (1-2 minutes)

**Total Target: <10 minutes/week**

### Supporting Agent Tasks:
- **Data Agent**: Automated result updates
- **API Agent**: Fast bet input endpoints with batch operations
- **UI Agent**: Streamlined admin interface with WhatsApp parsing tools
- **Testing Agent**: Validate admin workflow efficiency
- **Integration Agent**: Monitor system performance and uptime

## Command Quick Reference

### Common Cross-Agent Commands
```bash
# Check system status
curl -s http://localhost:5000/api/betting/standings | jq
curl -s http://localhost:3000 | grep -i "league"

# Data validation  
wc -l data/*.csv
grep -i "completed" data/*.csv

# Mobile testing
npm run test -- --coverage
python test_mobile_responsiveness.py

# Database inspection
sqlite3 betting_club.db ".tables"
sqlite3 betting_club.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM bets;"

# Performance monitoring
lsof -i :5000  # API server
lsof -i :3000  # Frontend server
```

### Agent-Specific Priorities
- **Data Integration**: Data quality and automation
- **Betting System API**: Speed and reliability  
- **Betting Club UI**: Mobile-first design and usability
- **Integration Testing**: End-to-end workflow validation
- **System Integration**: Production readiness and monitoring
