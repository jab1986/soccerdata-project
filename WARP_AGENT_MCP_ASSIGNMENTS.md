## How to Configure in Warp

### Step 1: Install MCP Servers
```bash
# These will be auto-installed when first used by agents
# ‚úÖ CORRECTED PACKAGE NAMES - All verified working
npm install -g mcp-server-sqlite-npx  # Fixed: was @modelcontextprotocol/server-sqlite
npm install -g @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem  
npm install -g mcp-server-fetch-typescript  # Fixed: was @modelcontextprotocol/server-fetch
npm install -g @modelcontextprotocol/server-github
npm install -g time-mcp  # Fixed: was @theobrigitte/mcp-time
npm install -g @modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking  # Added
npm install -g interactive-mcp-enhanced  # Enhanced version with better features
# Removed: WhatsApp server (invite-only)
```

### Step 2: Configure in Warp Settings
1. Go to `Warp Settings > AI > Agents > MCP Servers`
2. Add each server with the configurations from `warp-mcp-setup-guide.txt`
3. Set environment variables as needed

### Step 3: Assign to Agent Profiles
1. Go to `Warp Settings > AI > Agents > Permissions`  
2. For each agent profile, configure MCP server access:
   - **MCP allowlist**: Add the agent's primary servers
   - **MCP denylist**: Leave empty or add servers not relevant to that agent

### Step 4: Test MCP Integration
```bash
# In each agent pane, test MCP connectivity
# Data Integration Agent pane:
# Should have access to sqlite, fetch, filesystem, time

# Betting System API Agent pane:  
# Should have access to sqlite, time, sequential-thinking, interactive

# Betting Club UI Agent pane:
# Should have access to interactive, filesystem, sequential-thinking

# Integration Testing Agent pane:
# Should have access to fetch, interactive, github, sequential-thinking

# System Integration Agent pane:
# Should have access to github, filesystem, sqlite
```
